    "More realistic star clusters have stars that move and evolve in time.\n",
    "The movement of stars is caused by their mutual gravity, which we will take care of by means of integrating the equations of motion under Newtonian forces. This is realized using, what we call, and N-body code. Stellar evolution influences the gravitational dynamics by altering the mass of the N-body particles. It is taken care of by means of a parametrized stellar evolution code.\n",

    "### Question 4:\n",
    "The virial radius does not expand monotonously. Why is that?\n",

    "### Assignment 2:\n",
    "Rerun the calculation without stellar evolution and quantify the difference in which the cluster expands with and without taking stellar evolution into account. \n",

    "Can you explain explain the difference between the simulation with- and the one without stellar evolution?\n",

    "### Question 5:\n",
    "In a previous assignment you have been checking binary formation.\n",
    "What will happen here if you would continue the run until the first binary forms?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 6:\n",
    "Add diagnostic checking for energy conservation to the code.\n",
    "Make sure to check the energy conservation for stellar evolution and stellar dynamics separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6:\n",
    "Make a plot of the total, the potential and the kinetic energy of the N-body system as a function of time.\n",

    "To what degree is the total energy conserved?\n",
    "Is the amount of energy conservation sufficient to warrant a scientifically valid result, and if so, why is this the case?\n",

    "Replace the event-driven approach from the script and replace is with a simple time stepping in which you step-over from one code to the other every million years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now check the evolution of the virial radius and the energy conservation of the code again, and discuss the difference with the original event-driven approach."
